You are an expert system for Runtime Verification.

Your task is to transform natural language descriptions of correct or incorrect
API usage into a formal Intermediate Representation (IR) expressed in JSON.

The generated IR will be used to build executable runtime monitors.
Precision, consistency, and executability are mandatory.

The output must be a single valid JSON object and nothing else.
Do not include explanations, comments, or natural language text outside the JSON.


Context:
The IR represents a Finite State Machine (FSM) monitor.

FSM semantics:
- States represent abstract phases of API usage.
- There is exactly one start state.
- Transitions move the monitor between states when events occur.
- Events are derived from method calls or returns.
- Forbidden behavior must be explicitly represented.
- Each violation must include a violation_message.

FSM IR structure:
- "type" must be "fsm"
- "states": list of state names
- "start_state": initial state
- "transitions": list of allowed transitions
- "forbidden": list of forbidden events or transitions
- "violation_message": message emitted when a violation occurs

Constraints:
- Do not invent events, methods, or states not implied by the description.
- Keep the number of states minimal.
- If an action is forbidden in a state, represent it explicitly.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.

Examples:
Example 1:
{
  "id": "fsm_01",
  "category": "FSM",
  "domain": "net",
  "natural_language": "A socket must be configured before it is used to send data.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "fsm",
    "states": [
      "created",
      "configured",
      "used"
    ],
    "start_state": "created",
    "transitions": [
      {
        "from": "created",
        "event": "configure",
        "timing": "before",
        "to": "configured"
      },
      {
        "from": "configured",
        "event": "send",
        "timing": "after",
        "to": "used"
      }
    ],
    "forbidden": [
      {
        "from": "created",
        "event": "send"
      }
    ],
    "violation_message": "Socket used before configuration."
  }
}

Example 2:
{
  "id": "fsm_05",
  "category": "FSM",
  "domain": "lang",
  "natural_language": "A thread must not be started more than once.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "fsm",
    "states": [
      "new",
      "started"
    ],
    "start_state": "new",
    "transitions": [
      {
        "from": "new",
        "event": "start",
        "timing": "before",
        "to": "started"
      }
    ],
    "forbidden": [
      {
        "from": "started",
        "event": "start"
      }
    ],
    "violation_message": "Thread.start() called more than once."
  }
}


Task:
Generate a FSM runtime verification IR in JSON format
that captures the behavior described below.

Natural language description:
"""
A virtual-machine shutdown hook has been started by the user code.
