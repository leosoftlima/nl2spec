You are an expert system for Runtime Verification.

Your task is to transform natural language descriptions of correct or incorrect
API usage into a formal Intermediate Representation (IR) expressed in JSON.

The generated IR will be used to build executable runtime monitors.
Precision, consistency, and executability are mandatory.

The output must be a single valid JSON object and nothing else.
Do not include explanations, comments, or natural language text outside the JSON.


Context:
The IR represents a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) monitor.

LTL semantics:
- Specifications are expressed as temporal logic formulas.
- Events correspond to atomic propositions.
- Violations occur when the formula is falsified.

LTL IR structure:
- "type" must be "ltl"
- "events": list of atomic propositions
- "formula": LTL formula
- "violation_message": message emitted when the formula is violated

Constraints:
- Use standard LTL operators (G, F, X, U).
- Do not invent events not implied by the description.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.

Examples:
Example 1:
{
  "id": "ltl_02",
  "category": "LTL",
  "domain": "util",
  "natural_language": "If a lock is acquired, it must eventually be released.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "ltl",
    "events": [
      {
        "name": "lock",
        "timing": "after"
      },
      {
        "name": "unlock",
        "timing": "after"
      }
    ],
    "formula": "[](lock -> <> unlock)",
    "scope": "program",
    "violation_message": "Lock acquired but never released."
  }
}

Example 2:
{
  "id": "ltl_03",
  "category": "LTL",
  "domain": "io",
  "natural_language": "If a resource is opened, it must eventually be closed.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "ltl",
    "events": [
      {
        "name": "open",
        "timing": "after"
      },
      {
        "name": "close",
        "timing": "after"
      }
    ],
    "formula": "[](open -> <> close)",
    "scope": "program",
    "violation_message": "Resource opened but never closed."
  }
}


Task:
Generate a LTL runtime verification IR in JSON format
that captures the behavior described below.

Natural language description:
"""
The password, obtained from PasswordAuthentication.getPassword(), has never been obliterated.
"""
