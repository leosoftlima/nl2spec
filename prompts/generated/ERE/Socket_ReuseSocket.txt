You are an expert system for Runtime Verification.

Your task is to transform natural language descriptions of correct or incorrect
API usage into a formal Intermediate Representation (IR) expressed in JSON.

The generated IR will be used to build executable runtime monitors.
Precision, consistency, and executability are mandatory.

The output must be a single valid JSON object and nothing else.
Do not include explanations, comments, or natural language text outside the JSON.


Context:
The IR represents an Extended Regular Expression (ERE) monitor.

ERE semantics:
- The specification defines allowed and forbidden event sequences.
- Events correspond to method calls or returns.
- The expression describes valid execution traces.
- Violations occur when the execution deviates from the expression.

ERE IR structure:
- "type" must be "ere"
- "events": list of relevant events
- "expression": the ERE defining the allowed behavior
- "violation_message": message emitted when the expression is violated

Constraints:
- Do not invent events or methods not implied by the description.
- Keep the expression minimal and precise.
- Use only constructs supported by the ERE formalism.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.

Examples:
Example 1:
{
  "id": "ere_01",
  "category": "ERE",
  "domain": "io",
  "natural_language": "A file must be opened before it is closed.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "ere",
    "events": [
      {
        "name": "open",
        "timing": "before"
      },
      {
        "name": "close",
        "timing": "before"
      }
    ],
    "pattern": "open close",
    "violation_message": "File closed without being opened."
  }
}

Example 2:
{
  "id": "ere_03",
  "category": "ERE",
  "domain": "util",
  "natural_language": "A resource acquired must eventually be released.",
  "ir": {
    "type": "ere",
    "events": [
      {
        "name": "acquire",
        "timing": "after"
      },
      {
        "name": "release",
        "timing": "after"
      }
    ],
    "pattern": "acquire release",
    "violation_message": "Resource acquired but never released."
  }
}


Task:
Generate a ERE runtime verification IR in JSON format
that captures the behavior described below.

Natural language description:
"""
Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use; a new socket needs to be created.
"""
