Context:
The IR represents an event-based runtime monitor.

Event-based semantics:
- The specification defines constraints over individual events.
- Events correspond to method calls, returns, creations, or destructions.
- Each event must explicitly define its timing (before/after), parameters (if any), returning value (if any), and its pointcut definition.
- Violations occur when the monitored event is triggered under the specified pointcut condition.
- The monitor does not maintain explicit states or temporal formulas.

Event-based IR structure:
- "type" must be "event"
- "events": list of monitored events, each including:
    - name
    - kind
    - timing
    - parameters (if any)
    - returning (if any)
    - pointcut_raw or pointcut.raw (must preserve the raw pointcut expression)
    - body (if present)
- "violation_message": message emitted when the event constraint is violated (if explicitly defined)
- The violation condition is tied directly to the occurrence of the event itself.

Constraints:
- Do not invent events or methods not implied by the description.
- Preserve event names exactly as described.
- Preserve pointcut expressions exactly.
- Keep the structure minimal and precise.
- Do not introduce states, regular expressions, or temporal logic operators.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
