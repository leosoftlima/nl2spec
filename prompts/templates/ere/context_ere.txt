Context:
The IR represents an Extended Regular Expression (ERE) monitor.

ERE semantics:
- The specification defines allowed and forbidden event sequences.
- Events correspond to method calls or returns.
- The expression describes valid execution traces.
- Violations occur when the execution deviates from the expression.

ERE IR structure:
- "type" must be "ere"
- "events": list of relevant events
- "expression": the ERE defining the allowed behavior
- "violation_message": message emitted when the expression is violated

Constraints:
- Do not invent events or methods not implied by the description.
- Keep the expression minimal and precise.
- Use only constructs supported by the ERE formalism.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
