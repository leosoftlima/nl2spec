Context:
The IR represents a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) runtime monitor.

LTL semantics:
- Specifications are expressed as temporal logic formulas.
- Events correspond to monitored method calls, returns, creations, or destructions.
- Each event must explicitly define its timing (before/after), parameters (if any), returning value (if any), and its pointcut definition.
- Violations occur when the temporal formula is falsified during execution.

LTL IR structure:
- "type" must be "ltl"
- "events": list of monitored events, each including:
    - name
    - timing
    - parameters (if any)
    - returning (if any)
    - pointcut (with raw expression)
- "formula": object containing:
    - "raw": the LTL formula
- "violation_message": message emitted when the formula is violated

Constraints:
- Use standard LTL operators (G, F, X, U).
- Preserve event names and pointcut expressions exactly.
- Preserve the formula exactly as defined.
- Do not invent events not implied by the description.
- Do not convert the specification into FSM or ERE.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
