Context:
The IR represents a Finite State Machine (FSM) runtime monitor.

FSM semantics:
- The monitor behavior is defined by explicit states and transitions.
- There is exactly one initial state.
- Transitions occur when monitored events happen.
- Events correspond to method calls, returns, creations, or destructions.
- Violations occur when execution deviates from the FSM definition.

FSM IR structure:
- "type" must be "fsm"
- "events": list of monitored events, each including:
    - name
    - timing
    - parameters (if any)
    - returning (if any)
    - pointcut_raw or pointcut.raw (must preserve the raw pointcut expression)
- "fsm": object containing:
    - "raw_block": the FSM definition (must be preserved exactly as defined)
- "violation_message": message emitted when the FSM behavior is violated (if explicitly defined)

Constraints:
- Do not invent events, methods, or states not implied by the description.
- Preserve event names and pointcut expressions exactly.
- Preserve the FSM definition exactly as provided.
- Do not convert the specification into ERE or LTL.
- Follow exactly the structure shown in the examples.
