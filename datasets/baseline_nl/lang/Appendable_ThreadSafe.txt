The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: safe_append
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Appendable a, Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* Appendable+.append(..)) && target(a) && thread(t) && !target(StringBuffer) && condition(this.owner == null || this.owner == t)

2) Event name: unsafe_append
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Appendable a, Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* Appendable+.append(..)) && target(a) && thread(t) && !target(StringBuffer) && condition(this.owner != null && this.owner != t)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

safe_append*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"More than two threads attempted to use an Appendable instance, which may lead to a race condition"
