The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: createWithoutThrowable
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: Throwable t
   Pointcut: call(Throwable+.new()) || call(Throwable+.new(String))

2) Event name: createWithThrowable
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: Throwable t
   Pointcut: call(Throwable+.new(String, Throwable)) || call(Throwable+.new(Throwable))

3) Event name: initCause
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Throwable t
   Pointcut: call(* Throwable+.initCause(..)) && target(t)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

(createWithoutThrowable initCause initCause+) | (createWithThrowable initCause+)

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"initCause should not be called more than once."
