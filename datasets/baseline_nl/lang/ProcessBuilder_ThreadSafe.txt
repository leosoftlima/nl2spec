The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: safe_oper
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ProcessBuilder p, Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* ProcessBuilder.*(..)) && target(p) && thread(t) && condition(this.owner == null || this.owner == t)

2) Event name: unsafe_oper
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ProcessBuilder p, Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* ProcessBuilder.*(..)) && target(p) && thread(t) && condition(this.owner != null && this.owner != t)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

safe_oper*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"More than two threads attempted to use a ProcessBuilder instance, which may lead to a race condition"
