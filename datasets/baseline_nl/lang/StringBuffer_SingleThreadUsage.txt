The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: init
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Thread t
   Returning: StringBuffer s
   Pointcut: call(StringBuffer.new(..)) && thread(t)

2) Event name: use
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: StringBuffer s, Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* StringBuffer.*(..)) && target(s) && thread(t)

3) Event name: endprogram
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Pointcut: endProgram()

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

init use+ endprogram

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A StringBuffer instance is used in a single thread. You may replace it with a StringBuilder instance, which will be faster under most implementations."
