The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: start
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: startThread() && thread(t)

2) Event name: setDaemon
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* Thread+.setDaemon(..)) && target(t)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

setDaemon* start

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"setDaemon should not be set after the thread started"
