2) Event name: check
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: SecurityManager manager, Object context
   Pointcut: call(* SecurityManager.checkPermission(Permission, Object)) && target(manager) && args(.., context)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:
