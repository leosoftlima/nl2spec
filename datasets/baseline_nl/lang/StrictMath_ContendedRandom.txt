The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: onethread_use
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* StrictMath.random(..)) && thread(t) && condition(this.th == null || this.th == t)

2) Event name: otherthread_use
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* StrictMath.random(..)) && thread(t) && condition(this.th != t)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

onethread_use*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"StrictMath.random() is used by multiple threads. If there is contention, we recommend you to use Random.nextDouble()."
