The system behavior is defined in terms of explicit states and transitions.

The monitored events are:

1) Event name: register
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* Runtime+.addShutdownHook(..)) && args(t)

2) Event name: unregister
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: call(* Runtime+.removeShutdownHook(..)) && args(t)

3) Event name: start
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Thread t
   Pointcut: startThread() && thread(t)

The finite state behavior is defined as follows:

		unregistered [
			register -> registered
		]
		registered [
			unregister -> unregistered
			start -> started
		]
		started [
			exit -> unsafe
		]
		unsafe [
			exit -> unsafe
		]
	@unsafe {
		RVMLogging.out.println(Level.CRITICAL, __DEFAULT_MESSAGE);
		RVMLogging.out.println(Level.CRITICAL, "Invoking System.exit() in a shutdown hook was suppressed because it may lead to deadlocks.");

Any execution that deviates from the state transition behavior described above constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A violation must be reported when this condition occurs."
