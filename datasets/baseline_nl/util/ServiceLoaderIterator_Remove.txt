The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: create
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: ServiceLoader s
   Returning: Iterator i
   Pointcut: call(Iterator ServiceLoader.iterator()) && target(s)

2) Event name: remove
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Iterator i
   Pointcut: call(* Iterator+.remove(..)) && target(i)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

create remove

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The iterator returned by ServiceLoader.iterator() does not support removal."
