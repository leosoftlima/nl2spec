The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: create
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: Deque q
   Pointcut: call(LinkedBlockingDeque+.new(int))

2) Event name: add
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Deque q
   Pointcut: ( call(* Deque+.addFirst(..)) || call(* Deque+.addLast(..)) || call(* Deque+.add(..)) || call(* Deque+.push(..)) ) && target(q)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

create add+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use offerFirst(), offerLast() and offer() instead of addFirt(), addLast() and add()."
