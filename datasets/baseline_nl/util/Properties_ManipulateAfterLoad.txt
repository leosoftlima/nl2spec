The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: ( call(* InputStream+.read(..)) || call(* InputStream+.available(..)) || call(* InputStream+.reset(..)) || call(* InputStream+.skip(..)) ) && target(i) && !target(ByteArrayInputStream) && !target(StringBufferInputStream)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: call(* Properties+.loadFromXML(InputStream)) && args(i) && !args(ByteArrayInputStream) && !args(StringBufferInputStream)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ manipulate

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"read(), available(), reset() or skip() was invoked after Properties.loadFromXML() closes the stream."
