The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: create
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Closeable c
   Returning: Scanner s
   Pointcut: ( call(Scanner+.new(InputStream, ..)) || call(Scanner+.new(Readable, ..)) || call(Scanner+.new(ReadableByteChannel, ..)) ) && args(c, ..)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Scanner s
   Pointcut: call(* Scanner+.close()) && target(s) && !args(ByteArrayInputStream) && !args(StringBufferInputStream)

3) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Closeable c
   Pointcut: ( call(* InputStream+.read(..)) || call(* InputStream+.available(..)) || call(* InputStream+.reset(..)) || call(* InputStream+.skip(..)) || call(* Readable+.read(..)) || call(* ReadableByteChannel+.read(..)) ) && target(c) && !target(ByteArrayInputStream) && !target(StringBufferInputStream)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

create close+ manipulate

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The source stream or reader was used after the Scanner had been closed."
