The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: remove
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ListIterator i
   Pointcut: call(void Iterator+.remove()) && target(i)

2) Event name: next
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ListIterator i
   Pointcut: call(* Iterator+.next()) && target(i)

3) Event name: previous
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ListIterator i
   Pointcut: call(* ListIterator+.previous()) && target(i)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

((next | previous)+ (remove | epsilon))*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"ListIterator.remove() can be called only once per call to next()/previous()."
