The following events are monitored:

1) Event name: hasnexttrue
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Iterator i
   Returning: boolean b
   Pointcut: call(* Iterator+.hasNext()) && target(i) && condition(b)

2) Event name: hasnextfalse
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Iterator i
   Returning: boolean b
   Pointcut: call(* Iterator+.hasNext()) && target(i) && condition(!b)

3) Event name: next
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Iterator i
   Pointcut: call(* Iterator+.next()) && target(i)

The temporal property that must hold during execution is defined by the following formula:

[](next => (*) hasnexttrue)

If this temporal property is violated at any point during execution, it constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"Iterator.hasNext() was not called before calling next()."
