The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: createsublist
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: List b
   Returning: List s
   Pointcut: call(* List.subList(..)) && target(b)

2) Event name: modifybackinglist
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: List b
   Pointcut: ( call(* Collection+.add*(..)) || call(* Collection+.remove*(..)) || call(* Collection+.clear(..)) || call(* Collection+.retain*(..)) ) && target(b)

3) Event name: usesublist
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: List s
   Pointcut: call(* List.*(..)) && target(s)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

createsublist usesublist* modifybackinglist+ usesublist

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The backing list was modified while a sub-list is being used."
