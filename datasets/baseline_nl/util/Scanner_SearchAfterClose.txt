The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Scanner s
   Pointcut: call(* Scanner+.close(..)) && target(s)

2) Event name: search
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Scanner s
   Pointcut: ( call(* Scanner+.find*(..)) || call(* Scanner+.has*(..)) || call(* Scanner+.match(..)) || call(* Scanner+.next*(..)) || call(* Scanner+.skip(..)) ) && target(s)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ search+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A closed Scanner object attempted to perform search operations."
