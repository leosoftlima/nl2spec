The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: enter
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Map t, Map s
   Pointcut: call(boolean Map+.putAll(..)) && target(t) && args(s)

2) Event name: modify
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Map s
   Pointcut: ( call(* Map+.clear(..)) || call(* Map+.put*(..)) || call(* Map+.remove*(..)) ) && target(s)

3) Event name: leave
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Map t, Map s
   Pointcut: call(void Map+.putAll(..)) && target(t) && args(s)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

(enter leave modify*)*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The source map of putAll() has been modified."
