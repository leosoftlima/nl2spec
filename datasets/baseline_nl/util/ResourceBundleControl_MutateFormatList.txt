The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: create
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: List l
   Pointcut: ( call(List ResourceBundle.Control.getFormats(..)) || call(List ResourceBundle.Control.getCandidateLocales(..)) )

2) Event name: mutate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: List l
   Pointcut: ( call(* Collection+.add*(..)) || call(* Collection+.clear(..)) || call(* Collection+.remove*(..)) || call(* Collection+.retain*(..)) ) && target(l)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

create mutate

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The list returned by ResourceBundle.Control.getFormats() or getCandidateLocales() was mutated."
