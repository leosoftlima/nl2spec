The following events are monitored in this specification:

1) Event name: construct_len
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: byte[] buffer, int length
   Pointcut: ( call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int)) || call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int, InetAddress, int)) || call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int, SocketAddress)) ) && args(buffer, length, ..)

2) Event name: construct_offlen
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: byte[] buffer, int offset, int length
   Pointcut: ( call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int, int)) || call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int, int, InetAddress, int)) || call(DatagramPacket.new(byte[], int, int, SocketAddress)) ) && args(buffer, offset, length, ..)

A violation occurs when any of the monitored events is triggered under the pointcut conditions described above.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A violation must be reported when this condition occurs."
