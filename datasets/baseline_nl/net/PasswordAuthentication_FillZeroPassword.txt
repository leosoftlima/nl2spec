The following events are monitored:

1) Event name: read
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: Object pwd
   Pointcut: call(char[] PasswordAuthentication+.getPassword(..))

2) Event name: obliterate
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Object pwd
   Pointcut: call(* Arrays.fill(char[], char)) && args(pwd, ..)

3) Event name: endProg
   Timing: before
   Parameters: none
   Pointcut: endProgram()

The temporal property that must hold during execution is defined by the following formula:

[](read => o obliterate)

If this temporal property is violated at any point during execution, it constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The password, obtained from PasswordAuthentication.getPassword(), has never been obliterated."
