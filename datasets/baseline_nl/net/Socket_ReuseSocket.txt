The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Socket sock
   Pointcut: call(* Socket+.close(..)) && target(sock)

2) Event name: bind
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Socket sock
   Pointcut: call(* Socket+.bind(..)) && target(sock)

3) Event name: connect
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Socket sock
   Pointcut: call(* Socket+.connect(..)) && target(sock)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close (bind | connect)+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use; a new socket needs to be created."
