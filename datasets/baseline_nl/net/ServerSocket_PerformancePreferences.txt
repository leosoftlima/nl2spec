The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: create_bound
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(ServerSocket.new(int, ..))

2) Event name: create_unbound
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(ServerSocket.new())

3) Event name: bind
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(* ServerSocket+.bind(..)) && target(sock)

4) Event name: set
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(* ServerSocket+.setPerformancePreferences(..)) && target(sock)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

(create_bound | create_unbound set* bind+) set

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"Invoking ServerSocket.setPerformancePreferences() after the socket has been bound will have no effect."
