The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: getinput
   Kind: creation
   Timing: after
   Parameters: Socket sock
   Returning: InputStream input
   Pointcut: call(InputStream Socket+.getInputStream()) && target(sock)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Socket sock
   Pointcut: call(* Socket+.close(..)) && target(sock)

3) Event name: use
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream input
   Pointcut: call(* InputStream+.*(..)) && target(input)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

getinput close use+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"The input stream of a closed socket is about to be used."
