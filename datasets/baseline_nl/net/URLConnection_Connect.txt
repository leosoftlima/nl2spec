The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: explicit
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: URLConnection c
   Pointcut: call(* URLConnection+.connect(..)) && target(c)

2) Event name: implicit
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: URLConnection c
   Pointcut: ( call(* URLConnection+.getContent(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getContentEncoding(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getContentLength(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getContentType(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getDate(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getExpiration(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getHeaderField(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getHeaderFieldInt(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getHeaderFields(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getInputStream(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getLastModified(..)) || call(* URLConnection+.getOutputStream(..)) ) && target(c)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:
