The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: enter
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(* ServerSocket+.accept(..)) && target(sock)

2) Event name: leave
   Kind: event
   Timing: after
   Parameters: ServerSocket sock
   Pointcut: call(* ServerSocket+.accept(..)) && target(sock)

3) Event name: set
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ServerSocket sock, int timeout
   Pointcut: call(* ServerSocket+.setSoTimeout(int)) && target(sock) && args(timeout) && condition(timeout != 0)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

set* (enter leave)* set*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"ServerSocket.setSoTimeout() should be set prior to entering the blocking operation."
