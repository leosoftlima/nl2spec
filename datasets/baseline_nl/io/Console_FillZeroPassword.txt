The following events are monitored:

1) Event name: read

   Parameters: none
   Returning: Object pwd
   Pointcut: call(char[] Console+.readPassword(..))

2) Event name: obliterate

The temporal property that must hold during execution is defined by the following formula:

[](read => o obliterate)

If this temporal property is violated at any point during execution, it constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A password has never been obliterated."
