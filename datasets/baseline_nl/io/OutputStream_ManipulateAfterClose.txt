The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: OutputStream o
   Pointcut: ( call(* OutputStream+.write*(..)) || call(* OutputStream+.flush(..)) ) && target(o) && !target(ByteArrayOutputStream)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: OutputStream o
   Pointcut: call(* OutputStream+.close(..)) && target(o) && !target(ByteArrayOutputStream)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ manipulate+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"write() or flush() was invoked after close()."
