The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: close
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Writer w
   Pointcut: call(* Writer+.close(..)) && target(w)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

getwriter close+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"Invoking close() on the object returned by Console.writer() does not close the underlying stream."
