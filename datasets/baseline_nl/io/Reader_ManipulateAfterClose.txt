The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Reader r
   Pointcut: ( call(* Reader+.read(..)) || call(* Reader+.ready(..)) || call(* Reader+.mark(..)) || call(* Reader+.reset(..)) || call(* Reader+.skip(..)) ) && target(r)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Reader r
   Pointcut: call(* Reader+.close(..)) && target(r)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ manipulate+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"read(), ready(), mark(), reset() or skip() was invoked after close()."
