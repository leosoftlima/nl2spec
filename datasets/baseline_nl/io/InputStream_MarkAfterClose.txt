The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: mark
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: call(* InputStream+.mark(..)) && target(i)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: call(* InputStream+.close(..)) && target(i)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ mark+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"mark() after close() had no effect."
