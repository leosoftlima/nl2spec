The following events are monitored:

1) Event name: create
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: ObjectStreamClass c
   Pointcut: call(ObjectStreamClass+.new())

2) Event name: init
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ObjectStreamClass c
   Pointcut: ( call(* ObjectStreamClass+.initProxy(..)) || call(* ObjectStreamClass+.initNonProxy(..)) || call(* ObjectStreamClass+.readNonProxy(..)) ) && target(c)

3) Event name: endProg
   Timing: before
   Parameters: none
   Pointcut: endProgram()

The temporal property that must hold during execution is defined by the following formula:

[](create => o init)

If this temporal property is violated at any point during execution, it constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"An ObjectStreamClass object was instantiated, but was not initialized using initProxy(), initNonProxy() or readNonProxy()"
