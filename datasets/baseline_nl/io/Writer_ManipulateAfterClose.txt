The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Writer w
   Pointcut: ( call(* Writer+.write*(..)) || call(* Writer+.flush(..)) ) && target(w) && !target(CharArrayWriter) && !target(StringWriter)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Writer w
   Pointcut: call(* Writer+.close(..)) && target(w) && !target(CharArrayWriter) && !target(StringWriter)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ manipulate+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"write() or flush() was invoked after close()."
