The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: manipulate
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: RandomAccessFile f
   Pointcut: ( call(* RandomAccessFile+.read*(..)) || call(* RandomAccessFile+.write*(..)) ) && target(f)

2) Event name: close
   Kind: creation
   Timing: before
   Parameters: RandomAccessFile f
   Pointcut: call(* RandomAccessFile+.close(..)) && target(f)

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

close+ manipulate+

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"A closed random access file cannot perform input or output operations."
