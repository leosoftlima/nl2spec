The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: mark
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Reader r
   Pointcut: call(* Reader+.mark(..)) && target(r) && if ( r instanceof BufferedReader || r instanceof LineNumberReader )

2) Event name: reset
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: Reader r
   Pointcut: call(* Reader+.reset(..)) && target(r) && if ( r instanceof BufferedReader || r instanceof LineNumberReader )

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

mark (mark | reset)*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"BufferedReader and LineNumberReader allow reset() only after mark() has been invoked."
