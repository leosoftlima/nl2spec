The following events are monitored:

1) Event name: create
   Timing: after
   Parameters: none
   Returning: ObjectInput i
   Pointcut: call(ObjectInput+.new(..))

2) Event name: close
   Timing: before
   Parameters: ObjectInput i
   Pointcut: call(* ObjectInput+.close(..)) && target(i)

3) Event name: endProg
   Timing: before
   Parameters: none
   Pointcut: endProgram()

The temporal property that must hold during execution is defined by the following formula:

[](create => o close)

If this temporal property is violated at any point during execution, it constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"close() was not called."
