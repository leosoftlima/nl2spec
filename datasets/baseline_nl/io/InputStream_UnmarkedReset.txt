The following events are involved in this specification:

1) Event name: mark
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: call(* InputStream+.mark(..)) && target(i) && if ( i instanceof BufferedInputStream || i instanceof DataInputStream || i instanceof LineNumberInputStream )

2) Event name: reset
   Kind: event
   Timing: before
   Parameters: InputStream i
   Pointcut: call(* InputStream+.reset(..)) && target(i) && if ( i instanceof BufferedInputStream || i instanceof DataInputStream || i instanceof LineNumberInputStream )

The required execution pattern is defined by the following regular expression:

mark (mark | reset)*

Any execution trace that does not conform to this pattern constitutes a violation.

The violation message that must be used in the JSON output is:

"BufferedInputStream, DataInputStream and LineNumberInputStream allow reset() only after mark() has been invoked."
